# Terraform + Vault Integration to Deploy AWS EC2 Instance

This repository demonstrates how to integrate **HashiCorp Vault** with **Terraform** to provision an AWS EC2 instance. Vault is used to securely fetch dynamic AWS credentials, which Terraform then uses to deploy the EC2 instance.

---

## **Features**
- **Secure Secrets Management**:
  - AWS credentials are dynamically fetched from HashiCorp Vault's AWS Secrets Engine.
  - Secrets are never hardcoded in Terraform files.
- **EC2 Provisioning**:
  - A t2.micro instance is provisioned in AWS.
  - The instance uses a specified AMI and is tagged for identification.

---

## **Prerequisites**
1. **Terraform** installed:
   - Install Terraform from the official website: [Terraform Downloads](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
   - Verify installation:
     ```bash
     terraform -version
     ```

2. **Vault** installed and running:
   - Install Vault from the official website: [Vault Downloads](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/downloads).
   - Verify installation:
     ```bash
     vault -version
     ```

3. **AWS Account**:
   - Ensure you have an active AWS account.
   - IAM credentials with permissions to manage EC2 and Security Groups.


4. **SSH Key Pair**:
   - Create a key pair in the AWS Management Console.
   - Save the `.pem` file securely and update the `key_name` in `variables.tf`.

## **Step-by-Step Instructions**

### **1. Setting Up Vault**

1. **Start Vault**:
   - Run Vault in dev mode:
    ```bash
     vault server -dev -dev-listen-address="0.0.0.0:8200"
    ```
   - Note the **root token** displayed after starting Vault.

2. **Export Vault Environment Variables**:
     ```bash
     export VAULT_ADDR="http://0.0.0.0:8200"
     export VAULT_TOKEN="<root-token>"
     ```

3. **Verify Vault Status:**
   ```bash
   vault --version
   ```
4. **Enable the AWS Secrets Engine:**
    ```bash
   vault secrets enable -path=aws aws
    ```
Configure AWS Root Credentials:

5. **Replace `<ACCESS_KEY>` and `<SECRET_KEY>` with your AWS credentials:**
    ```bash
    vault write aws/config/root \
    access_key="<ACCESS_KEY>" \
    secret_key="<SECRET_KEY>" \
    region="us-east-1"   # Replace with your region
    ```
6. **Create a Role for AWS Credentials:**
   ```bash
   vault write aws/roles/dev-role \
    credential_type=iam_user \
    policy_document=-<<EOF
    {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:*",
                "sts:GetCallerIdentity"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
    }
   EOF
   ```    

7. **Verify Role Configuration:**
   ```bash
   vault read aws/roles/dev-role
   ```
8. **Test AWS Credentials from Vault:**
    ```bash
    vault read aws/creds/dev-role
    ```

## 2. Setting Up Terraform
1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
    ```bash
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```
2. **Add the following content:**
    ```bash
    vault_token = "<your-vault-token>" # Replace with your Vault token
    ```
3. **Terraform Commands:**

- Initialize Terraform:
    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```
- Format the Terraform files:
    ```bash
    terraform fmt
    ```
- Validate the Terraform configuration:
    ```bash
    terraform validate
    ```
- Plan the Terraform deployment:
    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```
- Apply the Terraform configuration:
    ```bash
    terraform apply -auto-approve
    ```

## Expected Outcome
1. **EC2 Instance:**

- A t2.micro EC2 instance is provisioned in the us-east-1 region.
- The instance uses the AMI ID specified in the main.tf file.
- The instance is tagged with Name: Vault-Terraform-Demo.

2 **Dynamic Credentials:**

- AWS access and secret keys are dynamically fetched from Vault's AWS Secrets Engine during execution.
  
3. **Security:**

- AWS credentials are not stored in the codebase or environment, ensuring secure operations.

## Preview of the Deployed Web Application
**Once the Terraform with vault deployment completes, navigate to the public IP address of your instance in the browser (e.g., http://<public-ip>)**

## Cleanup
To delete the resources created by Terraform:
```bash
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

## Troubleshooting
### Vault Issues
- Verify Vault is running:
```bash
vault status
```

- Ensure the Vault token is valid:
```bash
vault token lookup
```
### Terraform Issues
- Verify the Vault role path (aws/creds/dev-role) exists:
```bash
vault list aws/creds
```
- Check for typos in the Terraform configuration or environment variables.
### AWS Issues
- Ensure the root credentials configured in Vault have sufficient permissions.
- Verify the region and AMI ID are correct.
