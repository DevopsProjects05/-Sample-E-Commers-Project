***Prerequisites***

To set up the project on your local machine or server, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository from GitHub:


```git clone https://github.com/DevopsProjects05/Sample-E-Commers-Project.git```
cd Sample-E-Commers-Project/

## Step 2: Install Node Version Manager (NVM)
Install NVM:
Use Node Version Manager (NVM) to manage Node.js versions.

bash
Copy code
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
Purpose: Installs Node Version Manager (NVM).
Why to Use: To manage multiple Node.js versions easily and switch between them for different projects.

Reload the Shell Configuration:

bash
Copy code
source ~/.bashrc
Purpose: Reloads the shell configuration to apply changes.
Why to Use: Ensures the terminal recognizes nvm by applying environment updates.

Step 3: Install Node.js
Install the Latest Long-Term Support (LTS) Version of Node.js:

bash
Copy code
nvm install --lts
Purpose: Installs the latest Long-Term Support (LTS) version of Node.js.
Why to Use: LTS versions are stable and reliable for development and production.

Verify the Node.js Installation:

bash
Copy code
node -e "console.log('Running Node.js ' + process.version)"
Purpose: Verifies that Node.js is installed and working.

Step 4: Install Project Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install all required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Purpose: Installs all the dependencies required for the project to run.

Step 5: Run the Application
Start the Node.js server:

bash
Copy code
node server.js
Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to access the application.
